## Pre-review checklist
<!-- Use this checklist to help ensure your PR is ready for review. Not every item might be relevant, so only tick those that are.-->
- [ ] Branch is relatively up-to-date. We don't enforce branches being completely up-to-date with `main`, but we should try to avoid merging branches that diverged before significant changes were merged to `main`, since the likelihood of unexpected consequences increases.
- [ ] PR can be merged without conflicts with main.
- [ ] Pipelines pass.
- [ ] Only relevant files have been added to the PR.
- [ ] Documentation updated if appropriate.
- [ ] Code has been tested locally or in an appropriate environment and works as expected.
